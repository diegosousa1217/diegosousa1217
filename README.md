# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m *Diego Sousa!...*

I am currently responsible for ensuring software quality in the development pipeline, applying concepts from the shift left testing culture, 
improving the culture and quality process within the SDLC. I consider myself a hands-on professional who easily learns new technologies, business rules and quality
processes in software development. I am working with manual and automated tests in a project using the tools: Postman, Selenium Web Driver, Cucumber(BDD) , JUnit and 
RestAssured with standard page objects. In the project we use JIRA as an ALM tool for managing activities, git and github for versioning the automated test code. 
I have intermediate - advanced English, with excellent written and conversational understanding
